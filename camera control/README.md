#camera control
An A-Frame component that can be added to a camera so its movement can be stopped and started with head movemement.

## camera movement
The code for the camera movement and scene came from Craig Li on stackoverflow. The camera moves constantly in the direction the viewer is looking. The componet I wrote checks the difference between the last and current y rotation and if big enough will stop or start the camera moving.
